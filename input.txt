Now therefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,
in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and government
of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for
suppressing said rebellion, do order and declare that on the first day of January,
in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three,
all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State,
the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States,
shall then, thenceforward, and forever be free; and the Executive Government
of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof,
will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons,
and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them,
in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom. And I further make
it known that such persons of suitable condition shall be received
into the armed service of the United States.
